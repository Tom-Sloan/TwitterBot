                "Despise not death, but welcome it, for nature wills it like all else.",
                "Despise not life, but welcome it, for nature wills it like all else.",
                "A person’s worth is measured by the worth of what he values.",
                "In the morning, when you rise unwillingly, let this thought be present: I am rising to the work of a human being.",
                "Death smiles at us all, but all a man can do is smile back.",
                "Where a man can live, he can also live well.",
                "As if you had died and your life had extended only to this present moment, use the surplus that is left to you to live from this time onward according to nature.",
                "If you have been placed in a position above others, are you automatically going to behave like a despot? Remember who you are and whom you govern – that they are kinsmen, brothers by nature, fellow descendants of Zeus.",
                "The best answer to anger is silence.",
                "Poverty is the mother of crime.",
                "In a little while you will have forgotten everything; in a little while everything will have forgotten you.",
                "Nothing important comes into being overnight; even grapes or figs need time to ripen. If you say that you want a fig now, I will tell you to be patient. First, you must allow the tree to flower, then put forth fruit; then you have to wait until the fruit is ripe. So if the fruit of a fig tree is not brought to maturity instantly or in an hour, how do you expect the human mind to come to fruition, so quickly and easily?",
                "The present is the only thing of which a man can be deprived, if it is true that this is the only thing which he has, and that a man cannot lose something he does not already possess.",
                "He who lives in harmony with himself lives in harmony with the universe.",
                "Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth.",
                "Either you’re going to be depressed when your wish is not realized or foolishly pleased with yourself if it is, overjoyed for the wrong reasons.",
                "All you need are these: certainty of judgment in the present moment; action for the common good in the present moment; and an attitude of gratitude in the present moment for anything that comes your way."
